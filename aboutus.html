            <p class="aqua mainTitle fs-1 mx-2 text-center">2002: The year that ignited our spark</p>
            <p class="fw-light text-white px-4">In the morning of February 26, 2002, 20 year old Jack Anderson was setting up a tech store with some friends in Los Angeles, California. The first few weeks were rather calm, but once more clients started coming in the front door, a common question was daily being raised: "Do you have a website?". This simple inquiry sent Jack into deep research of the programming world, only to find out that the "simple" task of creating a website could only be achieved by hiring a programmer.<br> Jack spent months self-studying web development and finally built a flat website with redundant code and less than appealing visual elements. That's when he had a revolutionary vision: to start a software company that offers coding solutions to all kinds of clients. Jack and his friends studied and perfectioned their programming skills, which would end up with the foundation of <span class="aqua">Kronos Coding Solutions</span> on December 21, 2002. <br> In the following years, Jack and his team incorporated dozens of programmers and built a strong reputation among the software industry. Today, <span class="aqua">Kronos CS</span> has a skillful team of senior programmers with a passion for programming solutions that help our clients improve their products and their image.</p>

            <p class="fw-light text-white px-4"><span class="aqua">Kronos Coding Solutions</span> found its home in the breathtaking city of Stockholm, Sweden. Leaving Los Angeles, California in 2010, we travelled to a new destination as we decided to expand our headquarters. Today, we work in a high end office building just three blocks away from the Stockholm Concert Hall, where the Nobel Prize ceremonies are held every year. <br> Our building offers a break room, a modern kitchen and a meeting room (with a seating capacity of 30 people) on each floor, as well as a private parking lot and a food court on the first floor. Our headquarters have been cautiously designed to maximize our working potential and allow us to find a place to relax at the same time.</p>
